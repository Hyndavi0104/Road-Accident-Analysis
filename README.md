# 🚗 Road Accident Analysis Project

## 📋 Project Overview
The *Road Accident Analysis Project* aims to analyze accident data and create an *interactive dashboard using Power BI* to identify key trends, causes, and areas of concern.  
The dashboard helps stakeholders understand *accident frequency, severity, vehicle involvement, and yearly trends* — providing insights for better decision-making and road safety improvements.

## 🧩 Steps in Project

### ⿡ Requirement Gathering
Understanding the client’s needs and objectives for the project.  
In this case, the client wanted a *dashboard showing yearly accident and casualty statistics* to gain insights on trends and severity.

### ⿢ Stakeholder Identification
Identifying the key users and decision-makers who will use the dashboard — such as government departments, police, and road safety agencies.

### ⿣ Raw Data Overview
Analyzing the structure of the raw dataset — identifying key columns (like accident severity, vehicle type, date, and location), missing data, and inconsistencies.

### ⿤ Connecting Data with Power BI
Importing data from Excel or CSV into Power BI.  
> *Note:* If your Excel file doesn’t load properly, *convert it into a CSV file* and re-upload before connecting.
### ⿥ Data Cleaning
Using *Power Query* in Power BI to remove duplicates, handle null values, fix spelling errors, and standardize fields.  
For example: Replacing incorrect severity codes (e.g., Fetl → Fatal).

### ⿦ Data Processing
Performing data transformations and calculations using *DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)*.  
Creating new columns, time-based measures, and derived fields to make the data analysis-ready.

### ⿧ Data Modelling
Establishing relationships between multiple tables (fact and dimension tables).  
Creating a *Calendar Date Table* and linking it with accident data for time-based trend analysis.

### ⿨ Background Design in PowerPoint
Designing a professional and visually appealing background layout in *PowerPoint* and importing it into Power BI to enhance the dashboard look.

### ⿩ Data Visualization / Chart Design
Building visual elements such as:
- Bar and column charts for monthly trend  
- Donut charts for vehicle type distribution  
- Map visuals for accident locations  
- KPI cards showing total accidents, casualties, and severity  

### 🔟 Report / Dashboard Building
Combining all visuals into a single, interactive *Power BI dashboard*.  
Adding filters, slicers, and navigation buttons for better usability.
### 1⿡ Insights
Interpreting the visualizations to extract meaningful conclusions, such as:
- Fatal accidents are more frequent during nighttime.  
- Two-wheelers contribute the highest number of casualties.  
- Urban regions show a steady rise in accidents year-over-year.

## 🧾 Project Requirements

The client requested a *Road Accident Dashboard* comparing current and previous year statistics.  
This dashboard provides insights into accident trends, severity, and growth rates.

### 🔹 Primary KPIs
- Total casualties and total accidents (Current year vs. Previous year growth)
- Accident severity for both years  

### 🔹 Secondary KPIs
- Casualties with respect to vehicle type (Current vs. Previous year)
- Monthly trend comparison of casualties
- Casualties by road type and area
- Casualties by day/night
- Total casualties and accidents by location
